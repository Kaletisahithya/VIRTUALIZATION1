Lets see...............
Virtualization is technology that lets you create useful IT services using resources that are bound to hardware.It allows you to use a physical machines full capacity by distributing 
its capabilities among many users or environments. its the same hardware youre just using more of it more efficiently.

What is file system ?
 A file system is a process that manages how and where data on a storage disk typically a hard disk drive(HDD) is stored accessed and managed. it is a logical disk component
 that manages a disk internal operations as it relates to a computer and is abstract to a human user.  
 
  A file system usually consist of files separated into groups called directories.Directories can contain files or additional directories.Today the most commonly used file system
  with windows is NTFS.
  NTFS: NT file system which is also sometimes called the New Technology File System,is a process that the windows NT operating system uses for storing,organizing,and finding files on a
  hard disk efficiently.NTFS was first introduced in 1993,as a part of the windows NT 3.1 release.
  
   Some file systems used by linux are : EXT4,EXT3,EXT2-mostly linux used EXT4 file system because it is most stable and flexible file systems out there
                                           XFS,HPFS,VFAT,FreeBSD,FAT32 ...etc

VIRTUAL MACHINES:
             A computer inside a computer which thinks its the original computer but its not .virtual machine is a computer inside a physical computer. lets take my computer 
which is laptop it consists of hardware like CPU,RAM,STORAGE,GPC ETC  and it needs an operating system on top of it to use the system.in my computer I use windows as os,
but if u want to use linux then u dont need to buy another computer and install it ,by using virtualization we can put another computer in my computer and can install linux in it.
how is it done?  By using hyper visor ,the job of hypervisor is to create a bunch of small virtual computers in my computer those small computers are not physical. these small 
 virtual computers will have RAM,CPU,STORAGE everything a normal computer has.but actually it borrows that all those from my computer.i.e it uses my computer resources. this is 
 how a type two hypervisor function i.e Virtualbox.here windows is the host and the one we create and install using hyperware i.e. virtualbox that os is called guest.
 
 The type 1 hypervisoris VMware -- this is used in companies.this type will not be installed on top of the existing operating system.This will be installed directly on top of the hardware
 i.e. ram.cpu.storage etc .the companies will take vast amount of these hardware and directly install type1 hypervisor i.e. VMware.And then we can install any different type of os by allocating
 memory by splitting from the hardware.But both type 1 and type 2 hypervisors both do dthe same thing that is creating virtual machines.but here the hypervisor will be the host .
  setting virtualbox:
                     --need a real computer which is good like 4gb or more ram because the virtual machine which we create use our computer resources.
                     --should enable hardwarevirtualization support in advanced settings from BIOS if we want 64bit image .
                     --restart and press f12 and go to enter setup then we will go to bios, we should move to advanced --cpu configuration and enable intel virtualization 					 
	                 --download the iso of the type of os u want and also download hypervisor i.e. Virtualbox for windows and install it.
                     --virtualbox needs extension pack so we should download and should install that.
